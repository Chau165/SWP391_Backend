// Placeholder: ChargingStationApiServlet migrated to package `controller` (src/java/controller).
// This file intentionally contains no public class to avoid duplicate-class compile errors
// while the codebase is being migrated. Remove this file after a successful clean build
// and verifying that no JSPs or other classes reference com.swp391.servlet.ChargingStationApiServlet.
